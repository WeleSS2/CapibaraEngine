Basically it's like library with nice wrappers for a lot of things.
So we it's not and "engine" itself with gui e.t.c
main.cpp is only for tests, we will compile it and test did everything work correctly only. But we will not build a game itself, we need only to make a tests to check did everything is working correctly!
Games will be builded using "core" library where will be implemented our engine
We will use google tests as they are rather popular itself
